        <h2>Standardised Expanded Track Set SETS</h2>
        <p>SETS is the largest trackset avaliable for OpenTTD with a more than 64 railtypes. As such it has to be split into two separate newgrfs one for narrow gauge and standard guage respectively, with even more potentially on the table. Get it on Bananas or read more <a target="_blank" href="https://brickblock1.github.io/Standardised-Expanded-Track-Set--SETS/">here</a>.</p>

        <h2>ScaNDinavian Train Set (SNDTS) (Alpha)</h2>
        <p>SNDTS is an under development replacment for Swedish Trains, Danish Trains and the Norwegian (NSB) Trainset. Developed jointly by Me, BL, dP, and Meja. I am mostly working on swedish 892 mm trains at the moment but that will probably change at some point. Early alpha avaliable on Bananas, code avaliable on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/citymania-org/robs-trains">Github</a>.</p>

        <h2>French Trains Set (Narrow Gauge) Spoofer</h2>
        <p>French Trains Set (Narrow Gauge) Spoofer is a little grf I made when I found out French Trains Set (Narrow Gauge) doesn't work with any trackset but instead comes with a whitelist of supported sets. This newgrf pretends to be the accompanying trackset so that French Trains Set (Narrow Gauge) will work with any trackset. Download it <a target="_blank" href="spoofer.grf">here</a>.</p>

        <h2>Chips style dock objects</h2>
        <p>Chips style dock objects was made to make building large port complexes easier with the added benefit of matching nearby firs industries. Downloads are on Bananas and the code is on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Brickblock1/Chips-Style-Dock-Objects">Github</a>. Make sure to check out <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=1269754">ISR/DWE-style Objects II</a> too.</p>

        <h2>Trainset overrides</h2>
        <p>I have also made 3 newgrfs that override other trainset newgrfs, fixing them and/or adding Support for multi-voltage tracks so that they work with SETS. These are <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Brickblock1/Swedish-trains-fix">Swedish trains fixed</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Brickblock1/Danish-Trains-multivoltage-override">Danish Trains Voltage Override</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Brickblock1/DACH-multivoltage-override">DACH Multivoltage Override</a>, all are avaliable on Bananas.</p>

        <h2>Flowers and Road runway</h2>
        <p>Flowers and Road runway are two small newgrfs I made, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Brickblock1/flowers.grf">Flowers</a> replaces the rough ground with mushrooms and flowers but only works with the OpenGFX. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Brickblock1/Road-runway-airport">Road runway</a> is a small airport without the runway tiles allowing you to place anything in their place, be it a road or something else. Both are avaliable on Bananas</p>
